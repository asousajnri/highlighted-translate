    <h1>remarks made by Representative Adam B. Schiff of C</h1>

    <p>
      Complaining they were tired of listening to the Democratic impeachment
      managers repeat the same arguments day after day, and piqued by closing
      remarks made by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman
      of the Intelligence Committee, Republican senators close to President
      Trump began urging his defense team to mount a vigorous rebuttal focused
      on the substance of Democrats’ case, not just the process. Seizing on the
      House managers’ decision to talk at length about former Vice President
      Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden, Senator Lindsey Graham,
      Republican of South Carolina, called on the White House defense team to
      “make a compelling case” that there is something, based on good government
      and foreign policy, to look at here.”
